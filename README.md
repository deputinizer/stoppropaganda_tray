Release your anger for Putin when going AFK.

This program provides Windows tray icon that hides a regular console.

After 20 seconds of inactivity `stoppropaganda.exe` is started in order to make the world less dependent on Putin.

Path to the `.exe` file of your choice can be configured in `Idlerunner.toml`.
